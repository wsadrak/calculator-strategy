# CALCULATOR


A simple console application made in Java that simulates a calculator for for operations of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing floating point numbers.
The program communicates with the user and retrieves data from him, which allows him to calculate the result.

I made this program for learning exception handling, unit tests and Strategy Design Pattern.
